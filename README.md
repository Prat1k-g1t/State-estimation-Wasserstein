# State-estimation-Wasserstein
Inverse problem (state estimation) for measure-valued conservation laws. The problem is posed in the Wasserstein space (the space of probability measures with finite second moments). The project involves manifold learning (using Wasserstein barycenters), optimal sensor placement (using consensus-based optimization) and state reconstruction.
